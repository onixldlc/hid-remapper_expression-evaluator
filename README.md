# hid-remapper_expression-evaluator

[HID remapper](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper) expression is very useful when you want to create complex behavior from an input device (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, etc...) but figuring out the quirks of language can be very challenging. this project is trying to run trough the expression one by one [regex101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) style, and hopefully this can help you understand the language it self abit more and maybe simulate why your expression is not working.
